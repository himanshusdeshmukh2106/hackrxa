# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The LLM-Powered Intelligent Query-Retrieval System is a comprehensive document processing and query answering platform designed for insurance, legal, HR, and compliance domains. The system processes various document formats (PDFs, DOCX, emails), uses semantic search with embeddings, and provides explainable decision-making capabilities with structured JSON responses. It integrates with external APIs and maintains high accuracy, efficiency, and real-time performance standards.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a business analyst, I want to upload policy documents and ask natural language questions about coverage, so that I can quickly understand policy terms without manually reading entire documents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a PDF document via blob URL THEN the system SHALL parse and extract structured content from the document
2. WHEN a user submits a natural language query THEN the system SHALL process the query using LLM parsing to extract structured intent
3. WHEN the system processes a query THEN it SHALL return a JSON response with the answer and decision rationale within 5 seconds
4. IF a document cannot be processed THEN the system SHALL return an error message with specific failure reasons

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want the system to find relevant clauses and provide explainable decisions, so that I can trust and verify the system's responses for regulatory purposes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system matches clauses THEN it SHALL use semantic similarity scoring with a minimum threshold of 0.7
2. WHEN providing an answer THEN the system SHALL include clause traceability showing which document sections were used
3. WHEN making decisions THEN the system SHALL provide clear reasoning explaining how the conclusion was reached
4. IF multiple clauses conflict THEN the system SHALL identify the conflict and provide reasoning for the chosen interpretation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the system to handle multiple document formats efficiently, so that users can work with their existing document libraries without conversion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a PDF document is uploaded THEN the system SHALL extract text, tables, and structural elements accurately
2. WHEN a DOCX document is uploaded THEN the system SHALL preserve formatting context and extract all textual content
3. WHEN an email document is processed THEN the system SHALL extract headers, body content, and attachments metadata
4. IF a document format is unsupported THEN the system SHALL return a clear error message listing supported formats

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer integrating with the system, I want a RESTful API with proper authentication, so that I can securely integrate the query system into existing applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making API requests THEN the FastAPI system SHALL require Bearer token authentication via Authorization header
2. WHEN submitting queries via POST /hackrx/run THEN the FastAPI endpoint SHALL accept JSON payload with "documents" (blob URL string) and "questions" (array of strings)
3. WHEN processing requests THEN the system SHALL return JSON response with "answers" array containing string responses for each question
4. WHEN deployed THEN the API SHALL be publicly accessible via HTTPS with response time under 30 seconds
5. IF authentication fails THEN the FastAPI system SHALL return HTTP 401 with appropriate error message

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want the system to use embeddings efficiently for semantic search, so that query response times remain under acceptable thresholds even with large document collections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documents are processed THEN the system SHALL generate embeddings using Pinecone vector database
2. WHEN performing semantic search THEN the system SHALL retrieve relevant chunks within 2 seconds for documents up to 100 pages using Pinecone indexing
3. WHEN storing embeddings THEN the system SHALL use Pinecone's efficient indexing to support concurrent queries
4. IF Pinecone vector database is unavailable THEN the system SHALL fallback to PostgreSQL full-text search with degraded performance warning

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a cost-conscious organization, I want the system to optimize LLM token usage, so that operational costs remain predictable and scalable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing queries THEN the system SHALL use Gemini 2.5 Pro context window optimization to minimize token consumption
2. WHEN generating responses THEN the system SHALL implement prompt engineering with Gemini 2.5 Pro to reduce unnecessary token usage by at least 30%
3. WHEN handling multiple questions THEN the system SHALL batch process related queries to optimize Gemini API calls
4. IF Gemini token limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL chunk the request and provide partial responses with continuation indicators

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want the system to maintain high accuracy standards, so that business decisions based on system responses are reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN answering domain-specific questions THEN the system SHALL achieve minimum 85% accuracy on insurance policy queries
2. WHEN processing legal documents THEN the system SHALL achieve minimum 80% accuracy on clause interpretation
3. WHEN handling HR and compliance documents THEN the system SHALL achieve minimum 82% accuracy on policy questions
4. IF confidence score is below 70% THEN the system SHALL flag the response as uncertain and request human review

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a software architect, I want the system to be modular and extensible, so that new document types and query capabilities can be added without major refactoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding new document parsers THEN the FastAPI system SHALL support plugin architecture for easy integration
2. WHEN extending query types THEN the system SHALL allow custom logic evaluation modules with PostgreSQL storage
3. WHEN storing system configurations THEN the system SHALL use PostgreSQL for persistent configuration management
4. IF new domain requirements emerge THEN the system SHALL support configuration-driven customization stored in PostgreSQL without code changes
